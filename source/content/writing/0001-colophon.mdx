I designed and built this website myself. For years I wanted a positive and safe place to share my thoughts, ideas, knowledge, and the pictures I take. Thinking more about it, it was one of my goals for 2022:

::tweet{id=1477396862822985733}

But this article is being written in 2024, so what happened? It's not like I didn't build the website‚Ä¶ on the contrary, so far I've designed at least four other versions and even implemented them multiple times using different technologies. The issue is that **I'm a perfectionist and a chronic procrastinator** ‚Äì I'm also 99% certain I have ADHD, so that doesn't help.

You see, when I create something, it _has to be perfect_. It's a paralyzing thought that I've been able to keep more and more at bay in the last year, so here we are, I guess. Maybe I'll write an article about this topic as I have a blog now‚Ä¶ üëÄ

Ugh, enough backstory, or I'll get emotional; let's dive in the technicalities!

## The Tech

As mentioned above, I've built various iterations of this website in multiple frameworks, sometimes even multiple times using the same framework. For this version I chose to use [Astro](https://astro.build/) as it's simply amazing (and they keep making it better!) and has [the best content management API](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) I've ever used ‚Äì chapeau. [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) serves the output of a static build, so everything is built upfront.

I've tried keeping the client-side JavaScript code on a short leash. Currently, there are no frameworks, only raw JS. It powers the cute tooltips that appear above external links and <span class="decoration-dotted underline-offset-4 underline" data-tooltip="Look how awesome this thing is! ü•∫">custom elements</span> using [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/) and the menu that follows you around at the top. This might change tho: I'm considering using either [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com/) or [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/) for the menu as it's a bit convoluted managing the keyboard navigation and the open/closed state using just JS.

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) takes care of the styling (fun fact: it's been the only constant in every iteration) along with a tiny bit of custom CSS. All the content you see is written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), an overpowered version of Markdown.

## The Typography

Header and body copy are set in [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/). I'm using the variable version which allows using different weights while serving one file. Only one size is used to reduce complexity and remove distractions while reading.

Code blocks and inline snippets are set in [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/), which has quickly become my go-to monospace font in every application. Emphasized copy is set in [Lore](https://typeheist.co/font/lore/), a really cute, all-caps, handwriting font.

## The Commitment

As I said in the incipit, this website aims to be a positive and safe space, not only for me but also for others. I will try my best to stay positive and optimistic and use an inclusive language in all my posts.

For transparency, a tooltip appears while hovering over links to external websites that contains the full link.

Tracking is reduced to a minimum, using a self-hosted service that values privacy, uses no cookies, and is GDPR compliant. Collected data is anonymized, an irreversible process that results in data that cannot be linked to a specific individual.

Just like the [About](/about/) and [Uses](/uses/) pages, this will be a living article, which means it will always be up to date.

<Small>PS</Small> ‚Äî I would like to thank [Matt Pi](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62484130) for the realistic highlighter effect, as I'm using a slightly modified version. Whoever you are, you're a legend! üôåüèº
