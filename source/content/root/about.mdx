As you may have already guessed by the website's header, my name is Raul. I'm a frontend developer by trade, but I'm also kind of a _one-man-department_.

I've worked on anything you can think of: setting up â€“ and sometimes building from the ground up â€“ tooling and CI pipelines, designing architectures, leading teams, testing, all with a sprinkle of project and product management on top.

I love working on improving the developer experience of the projects I work on â€“ programming shouldn't be a painful experience! â€“ and taking care of the UI and UX of websites. These things seem to have something in common: **details matter**.

When I'm not working, I'm most likely programming (yes, it's also my hobby), taking pictures, geeking out about tech, or watching some movies or series, either at home or at the movie theater with my friends.

To make this page easier to consume and not bore you to tears, I've decided to write it in a QA format. Feel free to skim through it, you're welcome! ðŸ˜Š

## â€» When did you start programming?

In 2012 I started creating themes for a forum platform â€“ think Wordpress but for forums â€“ then, a year later, I started creating plugins as well. **At some point I had consistently more than 100k daily active users interacting with my plugins**!

## â€» What dishes do you cook well?

Pizza, pancakes, and pasta with a personal variation of pesto alla siciliana.

I've also just noticed they all start with the letter "P", weird coincidence ðŸ‘€

## â€» Do you have a favorite singer?

I used to not have any for a long time, but at this point in time I have some:

- [Ren](https://youtube.com/@RenMakesMusic) â€“ he's unreal, never felt so connected to any artist, ever!
- [Fletcher](https://youtube.com/@fletcher) â€“ her voice does things to my brain I can't explain ðŸ¤¯
- [SKYLAR](https://youtube.com/@SkylarOfficial) â€“ two words: pop perfection.
- [Elyanna](https://youtube.com/@Elyanna) â€“ music really do be "the universal language of mankind".
- [RAYE](https://youtube.com/@RAYEofficial) â€“ she deserves the world.

## â€» Do you have a favorite actor?

I do! Emma/Emily Stone (I'm still not sure, sorry ðŸ¥º) and Anya Taylor-Joy, both are so good and capable of delivering spectacular performances every single time.

## â€» Do you have a favorite movie?

Nope, I don't have one.

## â€» Do you have a bucket list?

Yes! I'll keep it updated by adding new stuff or crossing off the ones I complete.

## â€» Are there any people you'd like to high five in real life?

Yep, and as for the bucket list, I'll keep it updated!
